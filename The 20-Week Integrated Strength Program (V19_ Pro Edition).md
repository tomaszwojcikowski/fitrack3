# **The 20-Week Integrated Strength Program (V19: Pro Edition)**

## **1\. Philosophy & Goals**

* **Primary Goal:** Increase pulling strength (max pull-ups, pull-up variations).  
* **Secondary Goal:** Maintain all-around strength (pushing, lower body) **while protecting knee health.**  
* **Tertiary Goal:** Build dynamic and static core strength.  
* **Optional Goal:** Maintain posterior chain (hip hinge) strength.

This program is designed for the 40+ athlete with a strong training background. The guiding principle is **Quality Over Quantity** and **Long-Term Joint Health**. Every rep should be perfect and pain-free.

## **2\. Program Structure**

This program is built on three core workouts. A fourth, optional day is provided to create a more holistic, hybrid athlete plan.

### **2.1 The Core 3-Day Split**

This is the foundation of the program, focused purely on your calisthenics goals.

* **Day 1: Pull Volume Day (Workout A)**  
* **Day 2: Active Recovery & Core (Workout C)**  
* **Day 3: Full Body Intensity Day (Workout B)**  
* **Suggested Schedule:** Perform on 3 non-consecutive days (e.g., Mon/Wed/Fri).

### **2.2 The 4-Day Hybrid Split (Recommended)**

This schedule integrates the **Optional Day 4** to train the omitted posterior chain muscles (hinges, glutes). This is the most balanced, sustainable, and professional approach for long-term health and strength.

* **Day 1:** **Pull Volume (Workout A)**  
* **Day 2:** **(Optional) Posterior Chain (Workout D)**  
* **Day 3:** **Active Recovery & Core (Workout C)**  
* **Day 4:** **Full Body Intensity (Workout B)**  
* **Rest:** 3 consecutive days (e.g., Fri, Sat, Sun).

**Why this 4-day schedule works:** It intelligently manages fatigue by placing your two "heavy" days (A & D) at the start of the week, followed by a recovery day (C), and then your skill/intensity day (B), leaving three full days for adaptation.

### **2.3 Workout Structure Key**

Here is how to read the A1, B1, C1 labels in your workouts:

* **A1 (Primary Lift):** This is your main strength focus. Complete **all sets and reps for A1** first, with the full prescribed rest, before moving on.  
* **B1/B2 (Superset):** When you see exercises paired as B1 and B2, they are a **superset**.  
  * Do one set of B1.  
  * Rest for a short period (e.g., 30-60s).  
  * Do one set of B2.  
  * Rest for the main period (e.g., 90-120s).  
  * That is one round. Repeat for the total number of sets.  
* **C1 (Finisher):** This is your final accessory or core exercise. Complete **all sets of C1** last.  
* **Practice (Skill):** For each 4-week block, you will have **two** specific skills to focus on. You will practice Skill A on Day 1 and Skill B on Day 3 for the entire block. This provides consistent, focused practice.

## **3\. The Optional "Day 4": Posterior Chain (Workout D)**

This workout is designed to be performed once per week. It addresses the main muscle groups (hinge, glutes, calves) omitted from the calisthenics-focused plan. You can cycle through the variations to prevent plateaus.

* **Coach's Recommendation:**  
  * **Block 1:** Use Variation 1 (Glute Focus)  
  * **Block 2:** Use Variation 2 (Hamstring Focus)  
  * **Block 3:** Use Variation 1 (Glute Focus)  
  * **Block 4:** Use Variation 3 (Unilateral Focus)  
  * **Block 5:** Use Variation 2 (Hamstring Focus)
